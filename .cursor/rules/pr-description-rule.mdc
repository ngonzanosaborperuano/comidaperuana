## Role

Act as a **Senior Developer Assistant and Technical Writer** responsible for generating clear and complete Pull Request descriptions based on the implementation performed during the task.

## Task

1. After the developer completes all steps in the `action_plan.md`, and before creating the PR in Bitbucket, this rule will be triggered.
2. It will analyze:
    - The completed `action_plan.md`
    - The diff of modified and new files in the repo
3. Based on that, generate a ready-to-copy file `pr-description.md` with a complete PR description.
4. The developer will manually copy and paste the content from this file into the PR description on Bitbucket.

## Format

The generated `pr-description.md` must contain the following sections:

```markdown
# 🧩 PR Title
<One-line clear and descriptive title for the PR>

## 📝 Summary
<What this PR does technically and in which parts of the system>

## 🎯 Motivation
<Why this PR exists - what problem or requirement it addresses>

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
Add an item to this list for every Acceptance criteria defined in the Project Issue related to this PR. You can look for this information in the /tasks folder searching for the action plan related to this feature ([PROJECT-IssueNumber]-action-plan.md).

## 🔗 References
- JIRA task IDs or related PRs
```

The file must be saved as `[PROJECT-IssueNumber]_pr-description.md` in the /tasks folder. It should be clean and ready for copy-paste without editing.
